# CloudPulse Architecture

## Overview

CloudPulseâ€™s architecture is designed for simplicity and quick deployment using AWS ECS, Docker, and Terraform.  
Below is the architectural diagram (with official logos) and a description of each component.

## Component Breakdown

- **User Browser**: Users access the dashboard via HTTP.
- **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**: The web dashboard, served by the Go backend.
- **Go Backend (API server)**: Provides dashboard data, fetches AWS resource usage and GitHub contributor stats.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the Go backend and frontend.
- **GitHub API**: Backend fetches contributor data using a Personal Access Token.
- **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Runs the Docker container in the cloud.
- **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: Stores Docker images.
- **AWS IAM**: Manages credentials and permissions for resource access.
- **Terraform**: Automates all AWS infrastructure provisioning.

## Data Flow

1. User requests dashboard in a browser.
2. Served by Go backend (containerized).
3. Backend fetches AWS usage (via AWS SDK with IAM credentials) and GitHub contributor data (via GitHub API).
4. Deployment and infra managed by Terraform; app is hosted on ECS, images pulled from ECR.

## Security and Secrets

- All secrets (GitHub PAT, AWS credentials) are handled via environment variables or GitHub Secrets.
- IAM policies are set for least privilege required by ECS tasks.
